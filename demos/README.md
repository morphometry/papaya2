# Demos

There are four demos explaining how to use the `papaya2` library in this directory.
Type `make imganalysis` etc. to build one of the examples.
They are meant to be modified and adapted to your needs.

`imganalysis` and `sersic` need no external dependencies. They show how to analyze pixel data.

`ppanalysis` analyzes point patterns.  For building it the CGAL library is required.

`banana` analyzes astrophysics data in FITS format.  The `CCfits` library is required to build.
